## Description
This application will keep track of progress for various books and movies/shows the user enters into the database. It will also suggest what the user can read or watch next at random. When the user is done reading/watching the selected book/movie/show, it will be removed from the list. If the user is not yet done reading or watching, they can update what episode of the show or chapter of the book they are on.
